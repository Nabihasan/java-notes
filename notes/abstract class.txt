abstract class`
class a which is declare with keyword abstract is known as abstract class
or a class that contain atleast one method abstract (abstract method  means a method
doesnt contain body we will  declare abstract that method with abstract keyword).
we have to declare that class with abstract keyword.
abstract class may have abstract as well as non abstract method.
if any class will inherit abstract class then we have to override all the method of abstract class 
in child class otherwise child class also considered as abstract class.
"we cant create an obejct of abstract class but we can create reference variable of abstract class".

program
abstract class Rbi
{
	final void rules()
	{
		System.out.println("rules by rbi");
	}
	abstract void deposit();
}
class Sbi extends Rbi
{
	void deposit()
	{
		System.out.println("you can deposite in Sbi");
	}
}
class Demo
{
	public static void main(String gg[])
		{
			//Rbi r=new Rbi();//error
			Sbi s=new Sbi();
			s.rules();
			s.deposit();
			Rbi r=new Sbi();//upcasting
			r.rules();
			r.deposit();
		}
}


2.abstract class Demo
{
	static void show()
	{
		System.out.println("show is running");
	}
	abstract void display();
	public static void main(String gg[])
	{
		Demo.show();
	}
