interface
interface is mainly used to achieve full abstraction in java by default interface contains all the 
method as public and as abstract.
it means there is no need to put abstract keyword before method declaration.
we cannot put body of interface method before jdk 1.8.
interface can extends another interface.
but a class can implimenets one or more interfaces at a time.
when a class will impliment than inside the class we have to override all the method of interface  
with public access modifier.
otherwise we will declare child class with abstract keyword.


"we can not create an object of interface but we can create a reference variable of interface.
