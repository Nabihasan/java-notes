steps for jdbc connectivity
1.load the driver - as we know Driver is a class which is store in jar file. so we will load driver
 class from jar file with the help of static forName method of java run time class.
forName method throughs class not found checked exception. 

class - it is a java run time class which is used to optimize behaviour of a class at rum time.

 Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");

2.Connection established-when we will call static get
that contains url as string in arguments and returned implementation class object of Connection 
interface.

Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/adv","root","1234");

in url localhost is a server for mysql
3306 is port no. for mysql
adv is database name.
root is username of mysql
123 is password of mysql

3. write a query-we will write a query for insert,delete and update in String.


here is code

forName =Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
System.out.println("driver loaded");

Connection con=DriverManger.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/jdbcname","root","12344");
System.out.println("connection established");

String qr="insert into emp values(101,"hero")";
System.out.println("write query.");


Statement st=con.createStatement();
System.out.println("make a statement object");

int i=st.excuteUpdate(qr)
System.out.println(i+"record added");
