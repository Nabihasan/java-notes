Generics -
generics is a technology which is introduce in jdk 1.5 it is mainly used to type safe object. 
when we will use generic in our program than there is no need for type conversion and down 
casting.(type casting and down casting)

as we know we can store child class object in parent class reference variable this process
is called upcasting.
 
but if we want to store or convert upcasted reference variable into child class reference variable
we can manully typecast in child class reference variable this process is called downcasting.
